# TensorFlow Sequence Modeling
- In this project, I explored sequence modeling using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and GRUs in TensorFlow.
- You can get the code in [tensorflow_sequence_modeling.ipynb](./tensorflow_sequence_modeling.ipynb)

## RNNs and LSTMs
- Built a simple RNN and LSTM model for sequence prediction tasks using TensorFlow's `keras.layers.RNN` and `keras.layers.LSTM`.


## GRUs for Sequence Data
- Implemented Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for sequence prediction and demonstrated their effectiveness on time-series data.


## Training and Predictions
- Trained the models on sequential data and visualized the prediction results over time.


## Setup
- Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate virtual environment: `call venv/Scripts/activate.bat` in cmd
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Libraries
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
